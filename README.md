This template repository is the easiast way to create react projects from scratch without any bloatware that comes with `create-react-app`.\
Unlike CRA, it has only the minimum packages required to get a `react` project up and running. This results in a much lighter application and snappier performance.

### Built With

The only extra package configured along with vanila `react` is added support for `.scss` files.

-   `react 18.2.x`
-   `babel 7.18.x`
-   `webpack cli 4.x`
-   `sass` (Dart Sass)

Note: This repository is configured with [Dart-sass](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass) and not [Node Sass].
